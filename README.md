# About this project
For me, this is my biggest project. After doing multiple small Python apps, I decided it would be a good idea to put'em all in a bowl shake them, and TADAAM: you get this program. 
The name, Master Python Program is pretty much self-explanatory. It's a program you can run from which you can choose between other small programs that help you in your day-to-day life. 
You have a password manager, a password generator, a text encryption tool, a file encryption tool, a currency converter, a unit converter, and secure notes. 
All of these project's repos are linked in the last section.
